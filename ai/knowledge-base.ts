A: Each email address can only be associated with one account.

Q: I signed up with Google but now want to use email and password.
   Is that possible?
A: Social login accounts are linked to your provider. Contact support for
   account management options.


-- TRAILS --

Q: Why can't I create a trail?
A: Trail creation requires the Trail Guide role. Regular user accounts can
   ride and review trails but cannot create them. Contact TourenUp to apply
   for Trail Guide status.

Q: How do I find trails near me?
A: Use the Map tab — the map centres on your location and shows all nearby
   trails. You can also use the Nearby Sections feature to find specific
   skill segments within 10 km.

Q: What does the trail difficulty rating mean?
A: Trails and sections are rated Soft, Moderate, or Hard based on terrain
   type, technical challenge, and the steepness of the route.

Q: Can I download trails for offline use?
A: Yes. Open the trail while online and tap Save for Offline. The trail
   will then be accessible in Profile > Saved > Available Offline.


-- RIDES & RECORDING --

Q: Does the app track my location in the background?
A: Yes. When a ride is in progress, the app uses background location
   tracking to continuously capture your GPS path.

Q: What happens if I lose signal during a ride?
A: The app stores data locally. When connectivity is restored, your ride
   data syncs automatically.

Q: How do I pause a ride?
A: During a ride, tap Pause. Your progress is saved. Tap Resume to
   continue, or Finish to end the ride.

Q: Are my ride coordinates private?
A: Your GPS coordinates are stored on TourenUp's servers and used for
   performance analysis, section detection, and drill assessment. Refer
   to the Privacy Policy for full details.


-- SECTIONS & DRILLS --

Q: How does the app know when I'm riding a section?
A: Sections have GPS start and finish coordinates. When your tracked ride
   path passes through these points, the attempt is automatically detected
   and timed.

Q: What is a Sweat Point?
A: Sweat Points are earned for completing trail section attempts. They
   accumulate over time and determine your position on the general
   leaderboard. The harder the section, the more points available.

Q: Why didn't I get a drill result after my section attempt?
A: Drills require sufficient motion data to be analysed. If you did not
   carry your phone in a position that captures gyroscope and speed data
   correctly, the drill may not be processed. Also, drills are assigned
   progressively — you must pass earlier drills before unlocking later ones.

Q: Can I redo a drill?
A: Yes. Each new section attempt generates a new drill assessment. Ride
   the section again to get a fresh evaluation.

Q: What is a Coach Review?
A: A Coach Review is a personalised feedback session from a qualified
   riding coach. You submit your drill data and a video, and a coach
   reviews your technique and sends back written and video feedback.


-- SOCIAL & COMMUNITY --

Q: Who can see my profile?
A: Your profile is public to all registered TourenUp users. This includes
   your name, avatar, trails ridden, badges, and public photos.

Q: How do I stop someone from following me?
A: TourenUp currently uses an open follow model. You can remove followers
   by blocking (contact support) or adjusting your privacy settings if
   available.

Q: Can I message other riders directly?
A: Direct messaging is not currently a feature. You can interact with
   riders through likes, reposts, and by leaving reviews or condition
   reports.


-- SUBSCRIPTION --

Q: What features require a Premium subscription?
A: Access to certain advanced features, additional drill levels, and full
   leaderboard features may require Premium. The subscription screen shows
   the full list of included benefits.

Q: Will I be charged automatically?
A: Yes. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before
   the renewal date through the App Store or Google Play.

Q: Can I switch between Monthly and Seasonal plans?
A: Yes. You can change your plan from the subscription management screen.
   The change takes effect at the next billing cycle.

Q: I was charged but my subscription isn't active. What do I do?
A: Go to the subscription screen and tap Restore Purchases. If the problem
   persists, contact TourenUp support with your purchase receipt.


-- TECHNICAL --

Q: Which devices are supported?
A: TourenUp runs on iOS (iPhone) and Android devices. For the best
   experience with drills and motion tracking, a recent device (last
   3-4 years) is recommended.

Q: Why is my GPS path inaccurate?
A: GPS accuracy can be affected by dense tree cover, steep terrain,
   tunnels, or device-specific limitations. Riding in open terrain
   typically gives the most accurate tracking.

Q: Does the app work without an internet connection?
A: Yes. You can record rides, view downloaded trails, and access saved
   sections fully offline. Trail discovery, social features, reviews, and
   condition reports require a connection. See Section 23 (Offline Mode)
   for full details.

Q: How do I know if a trail is available offline?
A: Go to Profile > Saved > Available Offline. Trails you have saved appear
   here. If a trail is not in this list, open it while online and tap
   Save for Offline.

Q: My motorbike make or model isn't in the list. What do I do?
A: The app uses a curated catalogue of motorcycle makes and models. If
   yours is missing, contact TourenUp support to request it be added.

TOUREN-1 WEB APP — AI TRAINING TERMINAL FOR COACHES & RIDERS
==============================================================

Touren-1 is a separate web application connected to the TourenUp mobile app.
It is the terminal where riders (Pioneers) register for the founding program
and submit drill data, and where Pro Coaches review submissions to label
that data for training Touren-1, TourenUp's AI off-road coaching model.

There are two types of users on this platform:
- Pioneers (Riders) — Off-road motorcycle riders in the founding program
- Pro Coaches — Verified coaches who review and label rider performance


==============================================================
PART 1 — RIDER (PIONEER) WALKTHROUGH
==============================================================

WHAT IS A PIONEER?
------------------
A Pioneer is a founding rider who contributes ride data to train Touren-1.
The Founding 500 is a limited cohort — only 500 riders can hold Pioneer
status. Pioneers are assigned a permanent Pioneer number (e.g. #0042) in
the order they register. Numbering starts at #14.

STEP 1 — HOME SCREEN
---------------------
When you visit the Touren-1 web app, you land on the Home Screen.

- A live 3D globe shows all riders and coaches worldwide.
- Three trust indicators: current Pioneer count (out of 500), number of
  active pro coaches (8), and drills captured (500+).
- Click "Pioneer Program" or the "Founding 500" CTA to begin.

STEP 2 — PIONEER LANDING PAGE
------------------------------
This page explains the full program before you commit.

What you'll learn here:
- How it works: You Ride a Drill → AI + Coach Review → You Improve
- Data streams recorded automatically: video (phone camera), motion data
  (accelerometer, lean, pitch, yaw), and trail data from 3,500+ trails.
  OBD-II (engine RPM + throttle) is optional.
- Pioneer Tier rewards:
    Scout      — 3 coach-validated drills on 2+ terrain types → bounty
                 board access + scout badge
    Pathfinder — 3+ terrains, 2+ drills, good consistency → Touren-1
                 beta access + monthly coaching call
    Pioneer    — 18+ coach-approved rides → model credits, free annual
                 Pro subscription, physical patch

Click "Join the Founding 500" to start registration.

STEP 3 — REGISTRATION: STEP 1 OF 2 (YOUR IDENTITY)
----------------------------------------------------
Fill in:
- Name (required) — display name in the platform
- Location — type a city, select from autocomplete (uses Mapbox)
- Facebook Handle — optional, for community connection
- Email (required) — used for Pioneer updates and coach review matching

Click PROCEED (button disabled until name and email are filled).

STEP 4 — REGISTRATION: STEP 2 OF 2 (YOUR SETUP)
-------------------------------------------------
Select:
- Off-Road Experience Level — Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
- Motorbike Weight Class — Light Enduro, Medium-weight Adventure, or
  Heavy-weight Adventure

Click JOIN PIONEERS to save your registration.

STEP 5 — PIONEER CONFIRMATION SCREEN
--------------------------------------
After registration:
- Your unique Pioneer number is revealed with an animation (e.g. "#0042")
- A welcome message confirms your founding status
- Three next actions shown:
  1. Download the TourenUp mobile app (iOS or Android)
  2. Join the TourenUp Discord community
  3. Generate your first Drill Protocol
- You can Save Badge or Share Badge
- Click "Open My Pioneer Dashboard" to continue

Your data is permanently saved. Next time you visit, your profile loads
automatically from your browser.

STEP 6 — PIONEER DASHBOARD
----------------------------
The dashboard has three tabs:

Overview Tab
  - Active Mission Card — current assigned drill + button to generate the
    drill protocol
  - Pioneer Identity Card — name, number, tier badge, location, and stats
    (validated drills count, bike type, skill level)
  - Tier Progress Bar — how many more validated drills to reach next tier
  - Skill Profile Radar Chart — pentagon showing scores across 5 axes
    (Balance, Braking, Throttle, Body Position, Terrain). Grayed out until
    your first validated drill.
  - Coach Reviews — once a coach reviews your submission, their feedback
    appears here. Expand each card to read the full coach reply.

Ride Drills Tab
  - All submitted drills with current status:
      In Review   — submitted, waiting for coach
      Validated   — coach approved, counts toward tier
      Needs Redo  — coach flagged an issue, re-record required
  - Each drill card shows outcome (Clean / Partial / Failed), percentile
    ranking on that terrain, submission date, and any coach note.

Bounty Board Tab
  - Shows what data Touren-1 needs most, by drill + terrain + bike.
  - Each slot shows how many submissions are still needed (e.g. "0 / 20").
  - Urgent slots are highlighted in red.
  - Filling the last slot on an Urgent bounty earns a free 1-on-1 video
    review with a named coach.
  - Drills are recorded in the TourenUp mobile app — download links shown
    in each bounty card.

STEP 7 — GENERATE A DRILL PROTOCOL
-------------------------------------
From the dashboard, click "Generate Drill Protocol →"

1. Select a Drill — 5 drills in progression (each must be completed before
   unlocking the next):
     Balance Creep → Emergency Stop → Cone Slalom → Slow Stand-up →
     Hill Start Stop
   Locked drills show a lock icon and state what to complete first.

2. Select a Terrain — currently unlocked: Dirt, Gravel, Sand. Other
   terrains unlock in future updates.

3. Click GENERATE

The full Drill Protocol appears on the right side of the screen.

UNDERSTANDING THE DRILL PROTOCOL (20 ATTEMPTS)
------------------------------------------------
The protocol is a structured 20-attempt session designed to train Touren-1
on both correct and incorrect technique.

Block 1 — Reference (Attempts 1–3)
  Ride the drill exactly as your coach taught you. Gold-standard passes
  that establish your baseline. Rest 5 minutes after attempt 3.

Block 2 — Throttle Failures (Attempts 4–5)
  Intentionally use too much throttle in controlled ways. Teaches the AI
  what throttle errors look like in sensor data.

Block 3 — Clutch Failures (Attempts 6, 12–13)
  Clutch dump, no feathering, and clutch overslip.

Block 4 — Body Position Failures (Attempts 7–11)
  Five specific errors: sitting the whole drill, staring at front wheel,
  drooping elbows, weight too far forward, weight too far back.

Block 5 — Compound Failures (Attempts 14–16)
  Combine two errors at once (e.g. sitting + over-throttle).

Block 6 — Edge Cases (Attempts 17–18)
  Borderline attempts — not clean, not clearly failed. Push to the edge of
  your comfort zone.

Block 7 — End Reference (Attempts 19–20)
  Attempt 19: best effort while fatigued. Attempt 20: final gold-standard
  clean run.

Each attempt card shows:
- What to do (clear instruction)
- What the AI is learning from this attempt
- What sensations to watch for (red box)
- What telemetry TourenUp is measuring (gray box)
- How your specific bike and terrain affect this attempt

After generating your protocol:
- Download or share the drill card using the icons
- Open the TourenUp mobile app to record the session
- The app captures video + motion data for each attempt

RETURNING TO THE APP
---------------------
The web app saves your Pioneer profile in your browser automatically. When
you return, your name, number, and current drill are shown on the home
screen. Click your profile to go directly to your dashboard.

If you're on a new device, re-register with the same name and email — your
Convex data is matched by email.


==============================================================
PART 2 — COACH WALKTHROUGH
==============================================================

WHAT IS A COACH ON TOUREN-1?
------------------------------
Pro coaches review rider drill submissions, provide structured feedback,
and contribute to the consensus labeling system that trains Touren-1.
Each review is seen by up to 3 coaches before it's considered
consensus-labeled.

STEP 1 — COACH ACCESS FROM HOME
---------------------------------
On the home screen, click "Pro Coach Access" at the bottom of the page.

- If you've logged in before, the app recognizes you and shows a welcome
  message. Click to open your dashboard.
- If you're new, click to register.

STEP 2 — COACH REGISTRATION (1 STEP)
--------------------------------------
Fill in:
- Name (required)
- Location — type a city and select from autocomplete
- Facebook Handle — optional
- Email (required) — your identifier in the consensus system

Click JOIN COACHES to save. Your profile is stored in your browser and in
the Convex backend.

STEP 3 — COACH DASHBOARD
--------------------------
The dashboard is a two-panel layout.

Left Panel — Review Queue
  Shows all pending reviews assigned to you, with:
  - Rider name or email
  - Outcome badge (Clean / Partial / Failed — color-coded)
  - Consensus progress: "X/3 coaches"
  - Drill, terrain, bike, and submission date
  - Video icon if a video is attached
  The queue shows only reviews you haven't reviewed yet.

Right Panel — Review Details
  When you click a review in the queue:
  - Rider email
  - Drill, terrain, bike, review date
  - AI Summary — auto-generated analysis of the ride
  - Body Position Analysis (if available)
  - Common Mistakes identified (if available)
  - Success Criteria / Next Steps (if available)
  - Coach Reply — written feedback shown to the rider
  - Outcome badge
  - Video player (if a video URL is attached)

STEP 4 — REVIEWING A SUBMISSION
---------------------------------
1. Click a review in the left panel to open it
2. Read the AI Summary and coach feedback sections
3. Watch the video if one is attached
4. Click "Stage to Consensus" when you've reviewed it

This marks the review as seen by you. The review is removed from your queue.
Your name is added to the reviewedBy list. The consensus counter (X/3)
advances. Other coaches who haven't reviewed it will still see it in their
own queues.

MULTI-COACH CONSENSUS SYSTEM
------------------------------
- Every review needs up to 3 coaches to review it before it's fully labeled.
- The "X/3 coaches" badge shows how many coaches have already seen it.
- Each coach reviews independently — you will never see a review you've
  already staged.

ADMIN — LOGGING REVIEWS MANUALLY
----------------------------------
Admin coaches (specific verified email) see a "Log Review" button in the
bottom-right corner of the dashboard.

This opens the Coach Review Entry screen where you can manually enter:
- Rider Email (required — matches the review to a rider's profile)
- Drill, Terrain, Bike, Outcome, Review Date
- AI Auto-Summary (required — shown in rider's dashboard)
- Body Position Analysis, Common Mistakes, Next Steps (optional)
- Coach Reply (required — shown when rider expands the review)
- Video URL or upload a video file
- Raw Telemetry Notes

Load a file instead of typing manually:
  .eml file  — email from coach review system, auto-parsed to fill all fields
  .json file — structured review data, mapped directly
  .csv file  — telemetry export, populates raw data notes and review date

After filling all required fields, click "Save Review to Rider Profile".
The review appears immediately in the rider's dashboard and creates a
validated drill entry in their progression.

TOUREN-1 FAQ
==============================================================

-- FOR RIDERS --

Q: How do I record a drill?
A: Generate your drill protocol on the Touren-1 web app, then open the
   TourenUp mobile app. The app uses your phone camera and motion sensors
   to record each attempt. No extra hardware needed (OBD-II is optional).

Q: What happens after I record a drill?
A: Your data uploads automatically. A pro coach will review it within 24
   hours on average. The result appears in your Ride Drills tab with
   their feedback when done.

Q: How does the drill unlock progression work?
A: 5 drills in order: Balance Creep → Emergency Stop → Cone Slalom →
   Slow Stand-up → Hill Start Stop. A drill unlocks when the previous one
   reaches "Validated" status. Locked drills show a lock icon.

Q: What terrain types are available?
A: Currently: Dirt, Gravel, Sand. More terrains (loose stones, volcanic,
   etc.) are being unlocked in future updates.

Q: How is my Pioneer number assigned?
A: Pioneers are numbered in registration order starting at #14. The number
   is permanent and doesn't change.

Q: How do I reach the next tier?
A: Scout: 3 validated drills on 2+ terrain types. Pathfinder: 3+ terrains,
   2+ drills, consistent scores. Pioneer (max): 18+ coach-approved rides.
   Your tier progress bar is on the dashboard Overview tab.

Q: What is the Bounty Board?
A: The Bounty Board shows what data Touren-1 needs most, organized by
   drill + terrain + bike. Filling the last slot on an Urgent bounty earns
   a free 1-on-1 video review with a named pro coach.

Q: Can I use the app on a new device?
A: Yes. Re-register with your same name and email. Your coach reviews and
   drill history are stored in the cloud and matched to your email.

Q: Why are some attempts intentional failures?
A: The AI needs to learn what errors look like in sensor data, not just
   what correct technique looks like. Deliberately performing specific
   mistakes (throttle overload, clutch dump, wrong body position) teaches
   Touren-1 to recognize and diagnose those errors in other riders.

Q: What data does TourenUp collect?
A: Video (phone camera), motion data (accelerometer, lean angle, pitch, yaw),
   trail data (3,500+ mapped trails), and optionally OBD-II (engine RPM +
   throttle) if you connect an OBD-II adapter. All data is encrypted and
   used to train Touren-1.

-- FOR COACHES --

Q: How does the queue work?
A: The queue shows only reviews you haven't marked as reviewed yet. Each
   coach has an independent view — reviewing a submission doesn't remove it
   from other coaches' queues.

Q: What does "Stage to Consensus" do?
A: It marks you as having reviewed that submission. Your email is added to
   the review's internal record. The review disappears from your queue and
   the consensus counter (X/3) advances by 1.

Q: Do I need to write new feedback?
A: No. The review already contains AI-generated analysis and a pre-written
   coach reply. Your job is to read it, verify it's accurate, watch the
   video if attached, and stage it to consensus. Admin coaches can edit
   content before staging.

Q: Why do some reviews show 0/3 and others show 2/3?
A: The number shows how many coaches have already reviewed that submission.
   You can help complete the consensus for any review in your queue.

Q: Can I access another coach's queue?
A: No. Each coach sees only their own independent view.

Q: What email should I use for registration?
A: Use your real email address. Your coach email is the identifier used to
   track which reviews you've seen. A different email means the system
   won't know which reviews to hide from your queue.


==============================================================
TOUREN-1 TROUBLESHOOTING
==============================================================

My Pioneer number didn't appear after registration.
  Wait a few seconds and refresh. The number is computed from the Convex
  database in real-time. If it still doesn't appear, click "Open My Pioneer
  Dashboard" — your profile was likely saved successfully.

My drill protocol won't generate.
  Make sure you have selected both a drill and a terrain before clicking
  GENERATE. If a drill shows a lock icon, complete the previous drill first.

I can't see my coach review in my dashboard.
  Reviews appear in the Ride Drills tab and the Overview tab (Coach Reviews
  section). Allow up to 24 hours for coach review. "In Review" status means
  it's queued.

The coach queue is empty.
  You have reviewed everything in your current queue. New submissions will
  appear as riders submit them.

My location isn't found in the autocomplete.
  Try a broader search term (city or region instead of exact address). The
  location field uses Mapbox geocoding. If still not found, try a nearby
  larger city.

I registered as a rider but want to register as a coach.
  Scroll down on the home page to the "Pro Coach Access" section and register
  there with your email. Coach and rider registrations are separate flows.


==============================================================
TOUREN-1 TECHNICAL NOTES
==============================================================

- User identity is stored in the browser's localStorage
  (tourenup_pioneer_v1 for riders, tourenup_coach_v1 for coaches).
  Clearing browser data removes the local session but not the backend record.
- Drill progression is determined by the rideBlocks table in Convex,
  filtered by username and status="validated".
- Coach review matching uses the rider's email as the primary key.
- Pioneer number is computed dynamically: count of all isPioneer=true riders
  registered before you, plus 13 as a base offset.
- Consensus system: the coachReviews table has a reviewedBy string array.
  A review is shown to a coach if their email is not in that array.
